  // How to create that super powerful variable? - solution: React Hoooks (useState)
  // why it is called state variable? - It maintains the state of the conponent
  //! when we call the useState() it will return the state variable. we have to recieve it inside an array
  //!The super powerful variable keeps UI sync with data varaible and this is called Render. how? - solution: whenever the state variable updates, React will re-render the components.
  // Whatever we pass inside useState([]) is become default value to array variable (here ListOfRestaurants )
  // How to use useState retruning state variabe (here [ListOfRestaurants] ), we can use it as normal variable like ListOfRestaurants.
  //! How to modify that variable(ListOfRestaurants) since it is array. We cant modify like normal array. Since it is state variable returned by useState() we should modify it using function. that funciton comes as second parameter in that array (here setListOfRestaurants)
  // setListOf Restaurants used to update the listOfRestaurants
  let [ListOfRestaurants, setListOfRestaurants] = useState(resList);

            index is just the position of the item (like 0,1,2,3).
            If the list changes (adding, deleting, sorting items), the index values also change.
            React gets confused which item changed because the key also changes.
            Then React re-renders unnecessary items â†’ making app slow and buggy.
